Input Sorted: BINARY SEARCH
Max of Min / Min of Max: BINARY SEARCH
Generate all ways (count/best way/min-max): RECURSION => DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING
Counting unique: HASHING
Dimensions of binary tree: STACK/QUEUE (run till empty) or HEIGHT OF TREE MANIPULATION

Recurrence Relationship Shortcut
-Try to represent problem in terms of index
-Perform all possible operations on index according to problem statement
-If count all ways, find sum of all results
-If min/max, find min/max of all results
