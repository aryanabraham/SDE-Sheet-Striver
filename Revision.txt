<<Sort an array of 0's, 1's and 2's>>

Divide the array into three parts such that after traversal, 
all integers left of 'low' are equal to 0, 
all integers right of 'high' are equal to 2
and all integers between the two are equal to 1.

<<Kadane's Algorithm>>

Iterate through the array whilst maintaining two variables,
'currSum' and 'maxSum' that store the current and maximum sum
of the array respectively.

If currSum ever becomes less than 0, re-initialize it to 0 
as the sum of an empty sub-array is taken to be 0.
